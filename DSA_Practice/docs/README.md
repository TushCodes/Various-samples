# Java Tree Practice Ecosystem - Documentation

## Getting Started
- All code is in Java. Use the CLI in `dsa.java` or solve problems in the `problems/` folder.
- Compile with `javac *.java problems/*.java` and run with `java dsa` or `java problems.ProblemClassName`.

## Tree Basics
- **TreeNode.java**: Basic node for binary trees.
- **BinaryTree.java**: Binary tree with insert and inorder traversal.
- Trees are recursive structures. Each node can have left/right children.

## Practicing Problems
- Go to the `problems/` folder.
- Each file is a LeetCode-style problem with a starter function and main method for testing.
- Implement the function, then run the file to test.

## Adding New Problems
- Copy an existing problem file and change the class name and description.
- Write your own test cases in the `main` method.

## Useful Java Tips
- Use `System.out.println()` for debugging.
- Use recursion for most tree problems.
- Refer to the comments in each file for hints.
