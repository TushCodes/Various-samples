# Tree Data Structure Practice Ecosystem

This project lets you practice coding tree data structures and LeetCode-style problems in Java.

## Structure
- `TreeNode.java`: Basic node for binary trees
- `BinaryTree.java`: Binary tree with insert and inorder traversal
- `dsa.java`: CLI to interact with your tree
- `problems/`: LeetCode-style tree problems (starter code, test cases)
- `docs/`: Beginner documentation and tips

## How to Compile and Run

1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Compile all Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java problems/*.java
   ```
3. Run the CLI:
   ```bash
   java dsa
   ```
4. Run a problem file (example):
   ```bash
   java problems.MaxDepthBinaryTree
   ```

## How to Practice
- Open a file in `problems/`, read the description, and implement the function.
- Use the provided `main` method to test your solution.
- Add your own problems or test cases as you learn.

## Documentation
See `docs/README.md` for beginner tips, tree basics, and more resources.
